Hello, World!  
I'm glad to share my first project in **Java**, and actually, my **first project ever**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to practice **Programming Logic** with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  

For that, I applied the following concepts:

- 🖥️ **User Input:**  
  Using `Scanner` to allow the user to interact with the application.

- 🔀 **Control Flow Statements:**  
  - `if/else` statements  
  - `switch/case` conditions
  - 
- 🏗️ **OOP Principles:**  
  - Getters and Setters  
  - Class-based structure for handling **Bank Account** processes

## 📄 Bank Account Class Structure
### ✅ Attributes:

- `Account ID`
- `Account Type`
- `Account Owner`
- `Account Balance`
- `Account Status`

### ⚙️ Basic Operations:

- Open Account
- Close Account
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Pay Monthly Fee
